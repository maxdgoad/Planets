In order to run::::

first clone/download

```
npm install
```

If you have npm, the dependencies should now be installed, else install npm (and add to path on windows) and try again

In order for some of our dependencies to run, we need to host the files on a local server. 
Text editors like Brackets or Atom have this functionality already.

Example:
For brackets, make sure experimental live preview is selected in file->experimental live preview
Then click the live preview icon in the top right while you have the index.html open in brackets

This should open a page in your browser directed to local server brackets makes that is hosting the index.html
And you should see the code running now.
