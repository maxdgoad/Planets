features we want::

somewhat accurate solar system model
based on gravity and mass of planets ( their velocities and so forth, no special placements and so on)

ability to select a planet and have the camera move to that planet
the camera can then be dragged around the planet (and moon are also present)

planets have trails of their motion in the past few seconds

ability to add a planet of set mass and radius to a spot in the solar system and view how the system reacts. 
(adding a huge moon to the earth would do whatever it would to the earth and moons paths)

BLACK HOLE
if something gets to massive and the radius is not big enough to contain it, according to the proper equations 
we get black hole

possibly super nova 

ability to zoom out of the solar system and see what is outside and beyond (the game everything on steam)

music component::

Changing focus to one planet (selecting it and the camera moving)
